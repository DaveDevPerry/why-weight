# Why Weight?

<!-- A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is about. -->

An app to keep track of all your weight. Not only that, but you can create a group and invite friends to join and this displays progress in the form of a league.

<!-- ## Game Details

Each player choses ten numbers (from available lotto numbers range). Mark off each of your numbers if the ball was drawn in the official lotto draw. The winner is the first person to match all ten numbers. -->

## Motivation

I wanted to continue learning the MERN stack so I decided to build this app . Ultimately helping me closer to my goal of building out full stack applications.

## Code

I used the MERN stack for this. In addition it includes custom hooks and functions.

## Future Features

- Automated weight reminder emails or push notifications
- Progressive Web App
- Improved desktop layout design

<!-- ## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise. -->

<!-- ## Installation

Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running. -->

<!-- ## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples. -->
